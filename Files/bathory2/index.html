      <h1>Interesting Facts about Bathory</h1> 
      <ul id="somefacts">
        <li>Influenced and defined the sound of Black Metal</li>
        <li>When everything in Heavy Metal was about getting faster and more aggressive, Bathory did the opposite and released the iconic Hammerheart album.  </li>
        <li>Bathory was basically a one-man show, Quorthon the only regular member. Later the only member.
        </li>
        <li>Yes, the guy spitting fire is him</li>
        <li>At some point Quorthon recorded all instruments by himself!</li>
        <li>Quorthon died in june 2004, due to an inborn heart disease</li>
        <li>This was probably the reason Quorthon only toured during the early years of Bathory</li>
        <li>His true identity was practically unknown until after his death!</li>
        <li>To this day his songs are occasionally covered by bands such as: Ereb Altor, Watain, Emperor and many more!</li>
        <li>Some early songs were recorded in a garage or the bathroom to emphasize the low production quality</li>
        <li>He even released some rock albums under his pseudonym Quorthon</li>
        <li>In 2021 the band was elected into the Swedish Music Hall Of Fame</li>
      </ul>
