                    The question should rather be, what I am not interested in and what interests I pursue, 
                    since I'm curious about almost anything, be it engineering, music, history, phsyics, medicine or biology. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    On the other hand, insurances, bureaucracy and fashion are things I don't care about.
                </p>
